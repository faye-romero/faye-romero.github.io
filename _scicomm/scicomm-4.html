As part of the Genetic Society of America's <a href="https://genetics-gsa.org/career-development/early-career-leadership/">Early Career Leadership Program</a> (<a href="https://genetics-gsa.org/committee/early-career-scientist-multimedia-subcommittee/">Multimedia Subcommittee</a>), I help research for, interview for, and produce episodes for the podcast "Genetics in Your World". We aim to communicate current genetics research to a broad scientific audience by interviewing the authors of exciting new papers in <i>G3</i> and <i>Genetics</i>. <p>
