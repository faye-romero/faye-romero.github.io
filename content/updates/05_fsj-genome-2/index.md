#### Description

"A new high quality genome assembly for the Federally Threatened Florida Scrub-Jay (<i>Aphelocoma coerulescens</i>)" was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/advance-article/doi/10.1093/g3journal/jkae232/7778701?login=false">just published</a> in <i>G3:Genes|Genomes|Genetics</i>!
