#### Description

Check out our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.05.588142v1">new pre-print</a> for a new Florida Scrub-Jay genome assembly and annotation. Long-read sequencing and a linkage map helped us add ~260 Mbp of sequence and find a few more chromosomes in comparison to previous assemblies.
