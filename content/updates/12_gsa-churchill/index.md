#### Description

Can we discover the genetic basis of longevity in a diverse panel of mice? Find out by listening to the newest episode of the GSA's podcast "Genetics in Your World": <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/genetics-in-your-world/id1593075325?i=1000720893425">Age Is Just A Number: Mapping Longevity in Diversity Outbred Mice</a>! In this episode, I interview Dr. Gary Churchill (Jackson Laboratory) about the challenges involved in mapping loci responsible for complex traits and how we can translate longevity research in model organisms to humans.
