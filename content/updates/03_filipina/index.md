#### Description

I was interviewed by Science Corps Education & Research Fellow Swastika Issar (in partnership with the Central Visayan Institute Foundation) on my experience as a Filipino-American woman in STEM. There aren't many Filipinos and Fil-Ams in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, and we often go unseen (like so many others) due to being lumped under the monolith of "Asian". I was honored to share my story and research!
