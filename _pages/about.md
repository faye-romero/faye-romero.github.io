As a PhD candidate in [Nancy Chen's lab](https://popgenchenlab.github.io/), I’m interested in using population genomics to better understand how inbreeding impacts the fitness of small, threatened populations. Specifically, I’m investigating the genetics of inbreeding depression in the Federally Threatened [Florida Scrub-Jay](https://www.archbold-station.org/projects/long-term-florida-scrub-jay-project): how does elevated inbreeding manifest in the genome? What regions of the genome contribute to negative fitness outcomes (and ultimately, population decline) over short timescales?  
  
During my undergraduate at UC Berkeley in [Noah Whiteman's lab](http://www.noahwhiteman.org/), I used museum specimens from the [Museum of Vertebrate Zoology](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/) to explore how the morphology of Anna’s Hummingbirds has responded to decades of anthropogenic environmental changes, such as the introduction of hummingbird feeders.
