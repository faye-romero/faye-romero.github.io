I'm thrilled to share that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.70237">Alexandre, Romero, & English et al., "Supplemental Feeding as a Driver of Population Expansion and Morphological Change in Anna's Hummingbirds"</a> was published in <i>Global Change Biology</i> today!

This project (6 years in the making!) was driven forward by a large interdisciplinary team, and it was so exciting to watch all the pieces come together. I started photographing these hummingbird bills in 2019 as part of undergraduate research at UC Berkeley's Museum of Vertebrate Zoology. I'm now deep into a PhD in EEB, largely thanks to how fun I found this project and my inspiring graduate student mentor on the project, Dr. Nicolas Alexandre. I'm so grateful to have been a part of this amazing story!
